For 1 if you don't complete everything i wouldn't consider it speed running speed runners are just shit gamers why do you thinm they just rush everything makes no sense in story driven games aswell may aswell not even play the games
To me it doesn't count unless you beat it as the developers intended, exploiting a glitch is a noob tactic.
Speed running is just a stupid Ytber gimmick anyway. The fact there are multiple categories only makes it that much more dumb. Get a life and play the game yourself the way it's intended.
I used to speed run majoras as a kid all day remember when it released. Explain how this isn't a basterdized speed run? You know what basterdized means right? Again explain how someone can skip 99% of a game and have that equate to skill. So not playing the game is the new benchmark for skill :D :D :D :D again a sissies generation always looking for credit when doing none of the work, typical.
